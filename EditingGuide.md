## Contribute with GitHub

Before proceeding, you may assure yourself that you have knowledge of:
- basics of `git`: cloning repositories, making commits, rebasing a branch to the main branch, and syncing between upstream and local repositories;
- basics of GitHub: forking repositories, creating pull requests, and collaborate with other GitHub users;
- basic grammar of the YAML language: indentation rules, usage of dash, spaces, and quotes, and escaping from special characters;
- basic grammar of the Markdown language.

Otherwise, you can simply email your writings and advices to [info@one-among.us](mailto:info@one-among.us). Our staff will transform them to the proper format. We do not assume our contributors have to master any technical skills – at any time, you can work in a more “traditional” way and your contribution will also be highly recognized.
