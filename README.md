## About Us

We, One Among Us Transgender Support, or “One Among Us” for short, are a not-for-profit organization aiming at improving the awareness of transgender rights and providing community services. Now we operate [One-Among.Us](https://one-among.us), a memorial website for transgender individuals and allies who have passed away.

## Contribute to One-Among.Us

One-Among.Us is a fully open source website. The source code and articles are stored mainly in the three GitHub repositories: [`data`](https://github.com/one-among-us/data), [`web`](https://github.com/one-among-us/web), and [`backend`](https://github.com/one-among-us/backend). If you want to contribute only to the content of the website, you can simply focus on the `data` repo. 

### Content Contribution

If you want to leave a comment, simply use the forms in the website. If you want to contribute to the articles, you can follow the guidelines below:

- Our [Guide to Editing](EditingGuide.md).
- [*Preventing suicide: a resource for media professionals*](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/258814) by World Health Organization (Chinese version also available), if applicable.

### Technical Contribution

#### Write Commit Messages

Effective Feb 20, 2023, we adopt the commit message convention as follows for all One Among Us repositories:

> [*] Do something

The message should be written in English. Starting with a mark symbol in square brackets and separated by a space character, the headline should be a imperative sentence describing what you do and end without punctuation marks. Detailed descriptions are not mandatory but recommended if you find it complicated. We follow the 72-column line-wrapping rule.
