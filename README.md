## About Us

We, One Among Us Transgender Support, or “One Among Us” for short, are a not-for-profit organization aiming at improving the awareness of transgender rights and providing community services. Now we operate [One-Among.Us](https://one-among.us), a memorial website for transgender individuals and allies who have passed away.

## Contribute to One-Among.Us

One-Among.Us is a fully open source website. The source code and articles are stored mainly in the three GitHub repositories: [`data`](https://github.com/one-among-us/data), [`web`](https://github.com/one-among-us/web), and [`backend`](https://github.com/one-among-us/backend). If you want to contribute only to the content of the website, you can simply focus on the `data` repo.
